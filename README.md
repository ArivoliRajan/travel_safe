# Travel Informed

## Background
In 2018, the global Travel & Tourism sector grew at 3.9% to contribute a record $8.8 trillion and 319 million jobs to the world economy, and generated 10.4% of all global economic activity, according to the World Travel & Tourism Councilâ€™s (WTTC) annual research. The safety level of a country directly affects the travel business. For instance, in Colombia, decrease in crime level saw 10.7% increase of travelers. Conversely, in Venezuela, increase of crimes led to 7.2% drop of travelers. Travel agents, as well as travelers, must assure destination safety before making recommendations to clients or planning their next wonderful trip.
